# **Baking App**


### **Overview**

A project from my Udacity AND course following MVVM architecture.  Baking App downloads json containing recipe
details from Udacityâ€™s own API. It uses an Exoplayer to display videos, fragments to enable master-detail
layouts on tablets as well as mobile layouts, a Room data base to store downloaded data, live data, a repository,
view models, a home screen widget, a broadcast receiver to detect internet connectivity, an audio manager,
a media session and a rudimentary Espresso test with an idling resource.

If you are a Udacity student and you want to see this app running, you'll need to add the URL for Udacity's json
by finding the todo I left in there.
